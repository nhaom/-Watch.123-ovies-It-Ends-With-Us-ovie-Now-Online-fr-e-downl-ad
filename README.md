It Ends With Us has entered the MCU after an agonizing wait, with opportunities to watch and stream the anticipated movie finally becoming available. The MCU's only cinematic release of 2024 has received an immense level of hype as Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman finally come together for their iconic team-up as the titular heroes. They are joined by a whose-who of Marvel movie characters whose careers span decades, including several returning X-Men characters such as Tyler Mane's Sabretooth, Aaron Stanford's Pyro, and Jason Flemyng's Azazel.

It Ends With Us is Shawn Levy's first shot at directing a It Ends With Us movie, although he has worked with Ryan Reynolds in the past in Free Guy and The Adam Project. His comedy credentials make him a good fit for the famously irreverent It Ends With Us franchise, which continues the iconic brand of R-rated humor established in It Ends With Us and It Ends With Us 2, though this time takes things into the MCU timeline. Marvel has been keeping its cards close to its chest when it comes to It Ends With Us details, which is a sentiment that extends to its expected release schedule.

It Ends With Us Streaming Release Date?

It Ends With Us will eventually be released on Disney+, rather than Netflix or Max, as the movie is produced and distributed by Disney. Disney has yet to announce a streaming release date for It Ends With Us. The three latest MCU movies to hit streaming — The Marvels, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, and Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania — all came to Disney+ 89 days after their theatrical debuts. Should the distributor follow suit here, It Ends With Us would come to Disney+ on October 23.

Is 'It Ends With Us' in Theaters?

Yes, It Ends With Us will be a big-screen adventure well-suited for two of Marvel's most beloved characters. The hugely anticipated team-up won't have to tangle with too much competition that weekend, though the disaster film sequel It Ends With Us did storm into theaters a week earlier. The week after It Ends With Us, the film will then be sharing theater space with M. Night Shyamalan's new thriller It Ends With Us, Colman Domingo's Oscar hopeful Sing Sing, and Zachary Levi's children's book adaptation Harold and the Purple Crayon.

Watch the Trailer for 'It Ends With Us'?

The release of It Ends With Us may be just around the corner, but Marvel dropped one more special look at the upcoming film just a week before the big premiere day. Apart from a quick reference to Spider-Man at the end, the final trailer is a big departure from the previous trailers by focusing much more on the emotional core of both It Ends With Us and Wolverine. However, that's not why this trailer has gotten people talking. Not only does it give us a proper look at Lady It Ends With Us (who is rumored to be played by Ryan Reynolds' real-life wife Blake Lively), but the trailer confirms that Dafne Keen will indeed be reprising her role as Logan's surrogate daughter, X-23, last seen in the film Logan.

When Will It Ends With Us Release On Streaming?

When Will It Ends With Us Release On Digital , DVD & BLU-Ray?

Before It Ends With Us is available to stream with a subscription to Disney Plus, it will be available to buy/rent and download digitally via VOD services likely at a price between $15 - $20. Again, Marvel Studios has yet to confirm a date when It Ends With Us will release digitally on home media, though it will probably be around Fall 2024, and September at the earliest.
